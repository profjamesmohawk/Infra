<h1>Lab: Intro To Docker</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="description">Hopefully the reading assignment has peaked your curiosity about Docker. Now's your chance to get a bit of an understanding of how Docker works. This introduction should give you the basic skills you need to start designing and building Docker environments to satisfy the requirements of the projects to follow. It will not cover everything you need to know, there will be more research and experimentation required.</p>
<p>Today you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Docker CE on CentOS 7</li>
<li>Run some pre-built images</li>
<li>Build your own image</li>
<li>Publish your image to the public Docker repository</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon completion you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know the difference between and image and a container</li>
<li>Know how to run containers</li>
<li>Know how to publish containers</li>
<li>Have some questions like:
<ul>
<li>How do I manage network connections?</li>
<li>How do I manage persistent storage?</li>
<li>What's a swarm, and how do I build one?</li>
<li>What would be some good scenarios in which to use Docker?</li>
<li>How do I mange user accounts within a container?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Part A: Build a Docker host</h2>
<p class="description">One of the best things about Docker, particularly in a teaching or testing environment, is that it is very easy to set up and can run on many systems. You may choose any environment you like for this exercise, but we <strong>strongly</strong> recommend creating a VirtualBox VM running CentOS 7.&nbsp; Your instructor may also supply a pre-made Docker-ready base VM.&nbsp; If that's the case, proceed to step C.</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Build a CentOS 7 host configured like this</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><img src="docker_lab.png" alt="docker lab" /></p>
<ol>
<ol>Don't forget to:
<ul>
<li>set host names</li>
<li>update /etc/hosts</li>
</ul>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>You may need a crash course in CentOS 7 (your instructor can provide guidance)</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<h2>Part B: Install Docker CE</h2>
<p class="description">We will be using the Community Edition of Docker.</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the steps outlined here: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/centos/#prerequisites" target="blank">Install Docker CE</a></li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> Install from Docker's yum repositories.</li>
<li>Do <strong>not</strong> install the optional repos (<em>edge</em> or <em>test</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Congratulations, you should now be able to runt the 'hello world' container on both systems!</em></p>
<hr />
<h2>Part C: Running your first container</h2>
<p class="description">Walk through this guide: <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/beginner/chapters/alpine.md">1.0 Running your first container</a></p>
<hr />
<h2>Part D: Running web apps</h2>
<p class="description">Walk through this guide: <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/beginner/chapters/webapps.md">2.0 WebApps with Docker</a></p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>To access your web site for testing you may use wget or curl from the host or a fully blown browser from your VirtualBox host over the Host-only network. Don't forget to open the ports you'll need in the firewall. (hint: firewall-cmd)</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Part E: Apply your knowledge</h2>
<p class="description">Now that you know the basics of Docker and containers, it is time to apply what you have learnt. You will build and publish a static web site container with custom content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use this image as a base: <a href="https://store.docker.com/images/httpd" target="blank">Docker httpd image</a></li>
<li>Write a Dockerfile to reference the base image, copy in your content, and declare what ports should be exposed. <em>This will be a short file</em></li>
<li>Your site must contain:
<ul>
<li>A default home page, stating your name and student number</li>
<li>Your home page must have at least one link to an other page hosted by your container</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Publish(<em>push</em>) your image to the public docker registry
<ul>
<li>you will need to create an account</li>
<li>name your image YOUR_USERNAME/lab1_apache</li>
<li>make sure the image is public</li>
<li>have a classmate, try pulling and running your image</li>
<li><strong>Grading:</strong> Submit your Dockerfile to the eLearn dropbox for this lab. Place the name of your image, in the comments section, so your instructor can pull it.&nbsp; Make sure your Dockerfile includes a statement of authorship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h1>Lab: Intro To DRBD</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="description">DRBD is software based data replication solution that is commonly used to build small high availability clusters. In the next lab we will build such a cluster. Today we will concentrate just on DRBD.</p>
<p class="description">
<strong>Recommended O/S:</strong>Ubuntu 20.4 LTS <em>(d01 VM is a good place to start)</em>
</p>
<hr />
<h2>Part A: Orientation</h2>
<p class="description">The DRBD Users Guide, from LINBIT, is an example of an excellently written manual.</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the <a  href="./User_Guide_DRBD_9.pdf">User's Guide for version 9.0</a> </li>
<li>Install DRBD from Launchpad
<pre class="code">
add-apt-repository ppa:linbit/linbit-drbd9-stack
apt update
apt install drbd-utils drbd-dkms
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Part B: Build a DRBD configuration</h2>
<p class="description">Now that you know what DRBD is, it's time to consolidate your knowledge by building a simple test deployment.</p>
<h3>Start with this lab configuration:</h3>
<p><img src="drbd.png" alt="Lab Diagram" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Use the red network for DRBD replication traffic</li>
<li>Use one disk on each node for the O/S and one for DRBD</li>
<li>Create two replicated volumes, each 4 GB in size</li>
<li>Mount the DRBD volumes at /ha/data1 and /ha/data2</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Follow the LINBIT users guide you reviewed in Part A.&nbsp; Pay particular attention to parts  4 &amp; 6.</li>
<li>The d01 Ubuntu course appliance is a good starting point for luke and yoda.  </li>
<li>To install on Ubuntu: <span class=cmd>apt install drbd-utils</span> </li>
<li>Many <span class=cmd>drbdadm</span> commands will fail if not run by root.  But won't say that's way :( </li>
<li>To save typing <span class=cmd>sudo</span> repeatedly, try <span class=cmd>sudo -i</span>
</li>

</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Part C: Test</h2>
<p class="description">Let's see DRBD to it's thing.</p>
<ol>
<li>To test what happens if the communication link is severed, "unplug" one of the nodes from the red network.
<ol>
<li>What was reported on each node?</li>
<li>Does the primary still function?</li>
<li>What happens when the link is restored?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>To simulate a node crash of the secondary, power off the secondary node
<ol>
<li>What happened?</li>
<li>How did you recover?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>To simulate a node crash of the primary, power off the primary node
<ol>
<li>What happened?</li>
<li>How did you recover?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>optional advance:</strong> We can simulate a disk failure by removing the disk from the kernel's device table.
<pre class="code">
# make note of the SCSI ID of our DRBD disk
lsscsi

# use the address we just found to remove the device from the kernel (this change does not survive a reboot)
# NOTE: double check the address
echo 1 > /sys/bus/scsi/devices/3\:0\:0\:0/delete
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Part D: Better Tests</h2>
<p class="description">The tests we performed in Part C would be much more meaningful if the system was reading and writing from the DRBD volumes. Let's redo those tests, but with some activity on the systems.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a script or program that will create,read, and write files, 'as fast as it can' (or ask your instructor for such a script - see grading for details)</li>
<li>Re-run the tests from Part C with your script running.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Part E: Grading</h2>
<p class="description">This lab is worth a total of 10 points. Grades will be awarded as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate your working configuration to your instructor (10 points)</li>
<li>This demonstration may take the form of: zoom, recorded video, or the execution of a <a href="./host_info_drbd.sh">grading script.</a>
<em> (grading script to be run on luke with both volumes up and mounted) </em>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Lab: Intro To Git</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="description">Today we will explore the leading version control software, Git, and we get some more practice with Ansible and bash! </p>

<hr>
<h2>Theory</h2>
<p class="description">
Here's and excellent <a href="https://youtu.be/2sjqTHE0zok" target="blank">video from MIT</a> covering Git.  The first 30 minutes should be more than enough to get started.
</p>

<p class="description">
Developers use Git to track changes to software and to be able to 'roll back the clock' to view old versions of files.  Increasingly admins are using Git to track configuration files, particularly Ansible playbooks. 
</p>
<p class="description">
Even admins who choose not to use Git to version their own files, will often have to use Git to install and update software. For this lab  we will be exploring this strategy.  The development team responsible for the TRS application from the 3-Tier lab has published the application on GitHub, a public Git server. The project can be found at <a href="https://github.com/profjamesmohawk/trs" target="blank">https://github.com/profjamesmohawk/trs</a>
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p class="description">
Today will will focus on using Ansible with Git to install and configure the TRS application.  Frankly the developers have done a terrible job of creating installation scripts and documentation.  At work we <strong>might</strong> refuse to proceed until the developers provide installation documentation.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create an Ansible playbook, trs.yml, to install the TRS application and DB on a single new server.  </li>
<li>Create an Ansible playbook, trs2.yml to install the TRS application on two servers, one for the database and one for the web server.  </li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p class="description">
Submit your playbooks and any supporting files, like scripts, to Canvas.  Five points will be awarded for each playbook.  
</p>

<p class="description">
To earn a bonus of 2 points submit a text file identifying at lease two security problems you have come across while working on this lab.
</p>

<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<ul>
<li>The class Ubuntu VM comes with git installed.</li>
<li>Here's some Ansible module documentation you might find useful:
	<ul>
	<li><a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/git_module.html">Git Module</a> </li>
	<li><a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/script_module.html">Script Module (run a script)</a> </li>
	</ul>
<li>You may need to use the script module to invoke mysql in order to perform the initial DB load.  </li>
<li>The <strong>sed</strong> command might come in handy.
</li>
<li>Warning: trs/config.php will pose a challenge, especially when we need to deploy to two servers.  <em>(I am looking forward to your solutions.)</em>
	</li>
	<li>You may find it useful to have Ansible run some tasks locally on your control node. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18900236/run-command-on-the-ansible-host">This post might help.</a> (be careful it's from a forum)

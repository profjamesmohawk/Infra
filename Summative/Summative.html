<h1>Lab: Cage Match - Classic vs Docker </h1>
<p class="description">
The work we have done so far should have given us a descent understanding of what Docker is and how it works.  But can we answer the big question, "Should we adopt Docker?"
For this lab we will perform a head to head comparison of deployments to a very old school 'classic' environment and a Docker environment.
</p>
<p class="description">
We will promote an application from <strong>dev</strong> through <strong>test</strong> to <strong>production</strong> using two different hosting strategies .  We will also apply O/S patches in each environment.  The isolation of dev, test, and production environments is so common it is almost universal.  Many organizations have more than three environments, you may have heard terms like: integration testing, user acceptance testing (uat), pre-production, developer testing.  With the advent of virtualisation the number of environments supported has grown.
</p>
<em>For the purpose of this lab we will define:</em>

<div style="margin:10px;">
<strong>Application:</strong> The program and database required to perform a function.
</div>
<div style="margin:10px;">
<strong>Environment:</strong>  An instance of an application.
</div>
<div style="margin:10px;">
<strong>Shop:</strong> A simulated company.  For this exercise we will have two shops: Classic and Docker.
</div>

<hr>
<h2>What we will deploy:</h2>
<ul>

<h3>Application:</h3>
<p class="description">
We will deploy two versions of the trivial voting application we used in "Intro To Docker 2" lab.  We will call these version v1 and v2. 
<br><a href="./code.zip">Here's the code for our voting application(zip)</a>
</p>
<h3>Environments:</h3>
<p class="description">
We will support three environments: dev, test, and prod.
</p>
<h3>Shops:</h3>
<p class="description">
The details of the deployment strategies are somewhat arbitrary, and chosen to illustrate the pros and cons of each strategy.  They do reflect what one finds "in the wild".
</p>
<div style:"magin:10px">
<strong>Classic:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Two 'large' servers: dev01, and prod01.  </li>
<li>dev and test deployed to dev01 </li>
<li>prod deployed to prod01 </li>
</ul>

<strong>Docker</strong>
<ul>
<li>Two Docker hosts: devA and prodA </li>
<li>One service per container (httpd, mysql) </li>
<li>Use yml to define a Docker 'stack' for dev,test, and prod </li>
</ul>
</div>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Step 1: Build your servers</h2>
<p class="description">
Build the servers you will need.
</p>
<strong>Grading (1 points):</strong> Draw a block diagram of each environment and submit it to eLearn.


<hr>
<h2>Step 2a: Classic - Deploy the application to dev and test</h2>
<p class="description">
At first glance, this classic deployment may seem a trivial task.  There is one problem you need to solve... How will you keep the sites and databases separate?
</p>
<ol>
<li>Deploy v2 of the voting application to dev on dev01 </li>
<li>Deploy v1 of the voting application to test the dev01 </li>
<li>Test your deployment to make sure you have two isolated instances (vote counts should be different) </li>
</ol>
<strong>Grading (4 points):</strong> Submit a document describing your deployment.  Include addresses and port numbers for network connections.  Include a description of any application, DB, or httpd configuration changes you had to make.  
<br>
<br>

<h2>Step 2b: Docker - Deploy the application to dev and test</h2>
<ol>
<li>Deploy v2 of the voting application to dev on devA </li>
<li>Deploy v1 of the voting application to test the devA </li>
<li>Use yml to define a service for each instance of the application </li>
<li>Make sure that the DB data is stored outside of the container, it may be stored in the host file system.  </li>
<li>Name your images:
	<ul>
	<li>&lt;yourdockerid&gt;/votedb:v1 </li>
	<li>&lt;yourdockerid&gt;/voteweb:v1 </li>
	<li>&lt;yourdockerid&gt;/votedb:v2 </li>
	<li>&lt;yourdockerid&gt;/voteweb:v2 </li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Base your votedb image on <strong>mariadb:10.1</strong> <em>This is important to make sure patching is meaningful later in the lab</em></li>
<li>Base your webdb image on <strong>centos:7.3.1611</strong> <em>This is important to make sure patching is meaningful later in the lab</em> </li>

<li>Test your deployment to make sure you have two isolated instances (vote counts should be different) </li>
</ol>
<strong>Grading (4 points):</strong> Submit a document describing your deployment. 
<em><strong>Hint:</strong></em> Well commented yml and Docker files should be almost all you need.

<hr>
<h2>Step 3a: Classic - Promote to production</h2>
<ol>
<li>Promote v1 to prod on prod01 </li>
<li>The production data base should be 'reset', do not migrate the DB contents from test </li>
</ol>
<strong>Grading (2 points):</strong> Submit a set of instructions that a junior admin could follow to perform this task.

<h2>Step 3b: Docker - Promote to production</h2>
<ol>
<li>Promote v1 to prod on prodA </li>
<li>The production data base should be 'reset', do not migrate the DB contents from test </li>
</ol>
<strong>Grading (2 points):</strong> Submit a set of instructions that a junior admin could follow to perform this task.

<hr>
<h2>Step 4a: Classic - Promote v2 from dev to test</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do not reset the test data base. </li>
</ol>
<strong>Grading (2 points):</strong> Submit a set of instructions that a junior admin could follow to perform this task.

<h2>Step 4b: Docker - Promote v2 from dev to test</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do not reset the test data base. </li>
</ol>
<strong>Grading (2 points):</strong> Submit a set of instructions that a junior admin could follow to perform this task.

<hr>
<h2>Step 5a: Classic - Promote v2 from test to prod</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do not reset the prod data base. </li>
</ol>
<strong>Grading (1 point):</strong> Submit a set of instructions that a junior admin could follow to perform this task.

<h2>Step 5b: Docker - Promote v2 from test to prod</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do not reset the prod data base. </li>
</ol>
<strong>Grading (1 point):</strong> Submit a set of instructions that a junior admin could follow to perform this task.

<hr>
<h2>Step 6a: Classic - Patch dev and test</h2>
<ol>
<li>Run yum update </li>
<li>Verify that the applications still work </li>
</ol>

<h2>Step 6b: Docker - Patch dev and test</h2>
<ol>
<li>Patch the host O/S on devA </li>
<li>Patch the images for v1 and v2, giving them version tags of v1a, and v2a respectively. (By 'patch' we mean, 'use the latest version of the base container' </li>
</ol>
<strong>Grading (1 points):</strong> Submit a description of what you did to complete this task in the Docker shop. <em><strong>Hint:</strong></em> Well commented yml and Docker files should be almost all you need.

<hr>
<h2>Step 7a: Classic - New environment</h2>
<p class="description">
Deploy a new environment, qa, to dev01.  Use v1 of the application.
</p>

<h2>Step 7b: Docker - New environment</h2>
<p class="description">
Deploy a new environment, qa, to dev01.  Use v1 of the application.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Step 8: Is there a winner?</h2>
<strong>Grading (4 points):</strong> 
<ol>
<li>In which shop is patching simplest?  </li>
<li>In which shop is the deployment of a new environment simplest?  </li>
<li>In which shop is a promotion activity least likely to break an other environment?  </li>
<li>In which shop would it be easier to support two versions of mysql/mariadb?  </li>
<strong><em>Justify your answers.</em></strong>
</ol>

<h1>Lab: 3 Tier Deployment </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="description">
It is common to deploy applications in 3 tiers: presentation, application, and DB.  For this exercise presentation will be handled by the browser, application by PHP, and the DB by Mysql.
</p>
<p class="description">
We will deploy the trivial reservation system (trs), the one we use to book our lab systems, for this test.  The code is quiet ugly, but it will do for our purposes. <em>Do not use it as a PHP sample</em>
</p>
<h3>Here is what we will build today</h3>

<h2>Grading: </h2>
<p class="description">
You will demonstrate your work to your instructor and earn up to 10 points.
</p>
<p class="description">
But wait, there's more!  The lab configuration described will not allow any of your production servers to contact the internet to install packages.  The student who comes up with the best/most elegant/most interesting solution to this problem will earn <strong>2 bonus marks</strong>.  To earn your bonus marks submit a <em>short</em> description of your solution to the Canvas dropbox.  Include a reason why your solution is better than simply adding a NAT interface to each node.  
</p>

<h2>Part A: Install everything on a single server </h2>
<p class="description">
Before we spread the application across 4 servers we should be confident that we can make it work on a single server.  
</p>
<ul>
<li>Select any server you like, the course Ubunt VM is recommended, but use any OS you like. <br><em>(most of these tools are even available on Window$ for those of you who like that sort of thing.)</em>  </li>
<li>Get the application and data base script from GitHub (select <em>Download Zip</em>) <a href="https://github.com/profjamesmohawk/trs">https://github.com/profjamesmohawk/trs</a> </li>
<li>Install httpd and mysql/mariadb on your server <em>(for CentOS 7: mariadb mariadb-server php) (for Ubuntu: mariadb-client mariadb-server apache2 php libapache2-mod-php php-mysqli)</em>
</li>
<li>Run the <span class=cmd>build_trs_db.sql</span> script to create and populate the database.  </li>
<li>Install the php code found in <span class=cmd>trs</span> in <span class=cmd>/var/www/html/trs</span> </li>
<li>Test the app by going to &lt;your_server&gt;/trs/trs.php 
<ol>
<li>You should be able to log in as alice or bob (look in the sql to find their passwords) </li>
<li>If you can't login, look at the httpd error log, you may need to run <span class=cmd>yum install</span> one more time <em>(hint: yum list | grep -i php)</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Part B: Split the Deployment </h2>
<p class="description">
Now that we have the application working, it's time to start spreading the work load out. First we will split the web server and DB work.
</p>
<ol>

<li>Install the data base on db01 </li>
<li>Install the PHP application on w01 and w02 </li>
<li>Test your work by accessing the trs application on both w01 and w02 </li>
</ol>

	Hints:
	<ul>
	<li>You will need to modify <span class=cmd>config.php</span> </li>
	<li>You will need to allow remote DB access through the firewall (ufw/firewalld) </li>
	<li>mysql treats remote users with caution, you may need to run something like...
<pre class="code">
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'USERNAME'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD' WITH GRANT OPTION;
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>RHEL only: selinux may prevent httpd from opening TCP connections.  This might help...
<pre class="code">
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect=1
</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Ubuntu only: you will need to tell mariabd/mysql to listen on 10.2.1.40
<pre class="code">
grep bind-address /etc/mysql/*.conf.d/*
</pre>
	</li>
	</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Part C: Load Balancing</h2>
<p class="description">
We want w01 and w02 to share the work load of those keen users who want to access trs ;)
</p>
<p class="description">
We will use haproxy as our load balancer.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Install haproxy on lb01 </li>
<li>Confiugre haproxy to froward http requests to w01 and w02 by <strong>appending</strong> this fragment to <span class=cmd>/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg</span>
<pre class="code">
frontend http
  bind 10.2.1.10:80
  mode http
  default_backend web-backend

backend web-backend
   balance roundrobin
   server w01 10.2.1.20:80 check
   server w02 10.2.1.21:80 check
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<h2>Part D: Test from multiple browsers</h2>
<p class="description">
Test your handiwork from at least two browsers connecting to the bridged adapter on lb01.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Pay attention to the <em>server=[w01|w02]</em>message on each page.  </li>
<li>Do you stay on a server?  </li>
<li>Log in and see how things go.  </li>
</ul>
<strong>If you think everything is fine, you are mistaken - talk to your instructor.</strong>

<hr>
<h2>Part E: Make it sticky</h2><p class="description">
Tying a user to a specific back-end server for an entire 'session' is very important for web applications to run smoothly.
</p>
Here's a nicely written <a href="https://www.haproxy.com/blog/load-balancing-affinity-persistence-sticky-sessions-what-you-need-to-know/" target="blank">article</a> describing sticky sessions.

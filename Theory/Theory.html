<h1>Virtualisation Reading Assignment (How Did We Get Here)</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="description">As you depart Mohawk for your career, it will be important to keep your knowledge up to date. The best way to do that is to read. Today you will have an opportunity to practice this valuable skill. You will also practice the valuable skill of summarising key points from what you have read.</p>
<p class="description">You will read a series of articles, some of which are rather old, and answer questions based on their contents. The purpose of this exercise is to help you understand why the current set of virtualisation tools were created.</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p class="description">Provide your answers in the 'Virtualization Reading Assignment' quiz.&nbsp; Try to make your answers as short as possible - short, clear writing will impress your boss and your peers.</p>

<h2>Part A: The Failure of operating systems</h2>
<p class="description">This article from 2012 gives an excellent analysis of why hypervisors and containers were created. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target="blank" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/524952/">LCE:The failure of operating systems and how we can fix it</a></p>
<ol>
<li>What O/S limitations do hypervisors address? (4 marks)</li>
<li>What is the most significant hypervisor feature that containers can not address? (1 mark)</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Part B: Why is VMware still on top?</h2>
<p class="description">Here's an excellent overview of the current players. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target="blank" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/04/23/vms_compared/">If hpervisor is a commodity, why is VMware still on top?</a></p>
<ol>
<li>What four hypervisors are compared in the article and who are the main proponents of each? (4 marks)</li>
<li>What is the short, if somewhat glib, answer to the question, "What hypervisor should I use?". <em>hint: it is a two word answer</em> (1 mark)</li>
<li>Why does Mohawk college use VirtualBox so much? (2 marks)</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Part C: Technical comparison</h2>
<p class="description">These articles ( 
<a target="blank" href="https://blog.risingstack.com/operating-system-containers-vs-application-containers/">OS vs Application Containers</a> 
, <a target="blank" href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/vm-vs-containers/">VM vs Containers</a> 
) give a good technical comparison of virtual machines and containers. The author makes a distinction between O/S containers and application containers, in practice the lines between the two can be a little fuzzy so concentrate on the underlying technology as much as you can. The differences in practice will become much more clear when you use these tools to solve problems.</p>
<ol>
<li>Under which category would you place BSD Jails? (1 mark)</li>
<li>The simple jail you built in your Unix security course satisfies one type of name space isolation, which is it? (1 mark)</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Part D: Why it's time for containers</h2>
<p class="description">Containers, like Docker, are the cool new thing. These articles help to explain why, while reminding us that they are not the answer to every question. 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <a target="blank" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/04/07/containers_and_linux/">Linux is so grown up, it's ready for marriage with containers</a>

<ol>
<li>If you were offered a job at a start up whose mission was, "To create a desktop Linux distribution that will challenge Microsoft and Apple." Would you take the job? (2 marks)</li>
<li>For each of these scenarios, which virtualisation too would you recommend? Pick from: ESXi, HyperV, KVM, Docker, VirtualBox. A one or two sentence justification for each selection will suffice. (4 marks)
<ol type="a">
<li>You have ten old, relatively small and lightly used servers that you want to consolidate on a new box. The servers run a mix of CentOS, Ubuntu, and Windows.</li>
<li>You are a 100% Microsoft shop. You want to deploy a new server for a development and testing environment. It must host two development environments, and two test environments for an application that uses IIS and SQLServer. Environments must be capable of running different versions of ISS and SQLServer.</li>
<li>You are setting up server to support 30 students in a PHP course. All students will use the same version of PHP and Apache. Every student should be able to run Apache on port 8080.</li>
<li>You need to run Windows, CentOS, and Ubuntu on your laptop for testing and training.</li>

<h1>Lab: Private Docker Registry </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="description">
To date we have used the Docker public registry.  This is fine for testing, but not appropriate for production.  Today we will deploy our own private registry.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Part A: Provision the lab systems</h2>
<p class="description">
Design your own 'test' lab with the systems you need.
</p>


<hr>
<h2>Part B: Run an 'open' local registry</h2>
<p class="description">
Our first task is to install and run a local, completely open registry.  Fortunately, it is packaged as a Docker container, so this should be quick and easy.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Follow this <a href="https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/#run-a-local-registry">tutorial</a> up to "Storage Customization".  It is important that our registry store images somewhere other than 'inside' the container, we don't want to loose any.
</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Part C: Run an externally-accessible registry</h2>
<p class="description">
For production, we need to have a registry that is accessible to all the nodes on our network.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of what you need to know is contained in the tutorial from Part B </li>
<li>Use as self-signed certificate (Docker calls this "insecure") </li>
<li>Create two users: developer and admin </li>
<li>Test your access. </li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Part D: Grading</h2>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate your registry to your instructor.  </li>
<li>Submit a short document to eLearn answering the question, "What are the security risks of using a self-signed certificate?"
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Lab: 3 Tier Deployment to Production</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="description">
For this exercise we will expand on our 3-Tier architecture to make it ready for 'production'.  Our 3-Tier environment provided fault protection should we loose a web server but no protection against database server failure.  Today we will fix that. 
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Here is what we will build today</h3>

<br>
<strong>Note:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The load balancer is still a single point of failure.  We could easily create a cluster to address this, but we will consider our CentOS load balancer as a placeholder for the load balancer appliance that we would likely have in our production environment.  </li>
<li>You should be able to use w01, w02, lb01 from the 3-Tier lab without change.  </li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Design Decision</h3>
<p class="description">
Our database cluster needs storage.  You may choose to implement this using: DRBD, shared LVM disk, or file server.  
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Grading: </h2>
<p class="description">
You will demonstrate your work to your instructor or submit a short video.  Your video must demonstrate the failure of one node in the database cluster and a short statement defending your choice of storage.  <em>(e.g. I chose to use DRBD|LVM|FileServer because...)</em>
</p>
<p class="description">
For a <strong>bonus</strong> point identify the HUGE single point of failure that remains, for this exercise consider each VM a bare-metal server.

<h1>COMP-10097 Project Inventory
</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class="description">
This document contains a list of suggested projects.  These are just suggestions, any relevant project is acceptable.  Be sure to check with your instructor before starting any project for which you want credit.  The number of points awarded for any project will depend on scope and quality of your solution.  A given project could vary greatly in scope from quick proof of concept (POC) to production ready.  Discuss scope with your instructor before starting the project to avoid surprises.  
</p>
<p class="description">
A project's scope may also grow after it has started or even completed.  A proof of concept could lead to a product quality implementation.  A working system might lead to a performance testing project.  Don't hesitate to talk to your instructor about scope.

<h2>A Replacement for "Deepfreeze"</h2>
<p class="description">
You should all be familiar with the Deepfreeze product used to protect the integrity of Mohawk's lab systems.  It should be possible to build a similar system using visualization tools.
</p>
<p class="description">
Consider a system in which a "locked-down" base O/S image boots and presents the user with a menu of immutable VM images to boot.
</p>
<strong>Likely Scope: 5-10 points</strong>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>VDI Environment</h2>
<p class="description">
Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) allows "think" clients to run desktop O/S images hosted on servers.  This is usually sold as a way to protect corporate data, as all data remains safe in the data centre.  Citrix is the big player in this space.  Your challenge is to build a VDI environment.  The easy, low mark way would be to install a demo version of a commercial tool like Citrix and perform some functionality and performance tests.  A far more interesting task is to build your own using more basic tools.
</p>
Some things to consider:
<ul>
<li>What image O/S do we need to support? (Ubuntu is likely a better choice then Window$ because of licensing) </li>
<li>What kind of clients to we need to support? (A Windows or Linux client might be good choices.  Can you present the desktop in a browser?  On a phone?) </li>
<li>Should each desktop be a VM or a container?  </li>
<li>Does each user get a unique desktop on which they can install software, or does everyone get the same image?  </li>
<li>How many concurrent users can one node support?  </li>
<li>How much network bandwidth is required per user?  </li>
<li>How much server memory and disk space is required per user?  </li>
</ul>
<strong>Likely Scope: 10 - 50 points</strong>

<h2>Web Hosting Infrastructure - Many Small Sites</h2>
<p class="description">
M&S consulting wants to get into the hosting business.  Bullwinkle has boldly stated, "If Amazon can do it, we can do it better."  Rather than challenging AWS head on, consider building an environment to host a large number of small web sites.
</p>
Some things to consider:
<ul>
<li>What server applications do your customers need (php, mysql, ...)? </li>
<li>How will you bill?  </li>
<li>Do you need a load balancer?  </li>
<li>Should your server farm scale to more than one server?  </li>
<li>How many sites can one server support?  </li>
<li>How much traffic can one server support?  </li>
</ul>
<strong>Likely Scope: 10 - 30 points</strong>

<hr>
<h2>Web Hosting Infrastructure - One Large Site</h2>
<p class="description">
Many web sites need more power than one server can deliver.  Design and implement infrastructure to allow many nodes to satisfy requests to a singe web site.
</p>
Some things to consider:
<ul>
<li>What sort of load balancer will you use?  </li>
<li>How do you add or remove a node from the farm?  </li>
<li>How do you tell how busy your farm is?  </li>
</ul>
<strong>Likely Scope: 10 - 30 points</strong>

<hr>
<h2>Unix Fundamentals for Remote Users </h2>
<p class="description">
The current offering of Unix Fundamentals requires students to run a CentOS VM containing course files.  This works very well for on-site students, but does not support remote, on-line only students.  Design a server based solution to present terminal window access to a remote students.
</p>
Some things to consider:
<ul>
<li>Can you automate creation of student images/VMs/containers? (won't be attractive if we must add students one at a time) </li>
<li>Should the image be immutable? (this would help with support) </li>
<li>How many students can be supported on one server?  </li>
<li>What are the student's client software requirements. (ssh client, can you limit requirements to a browser?) </li>
</ul>
<strong>Likely Scope: 5 - 15 points</strong>

<hr>
<h2>Home Brew Container Manager GUI</h2>
<p class="description">
This one is for the aspiring coders.  Docker's commercial container manager, Universal Control Panel, is "just" a nice wrapper on functionality available from the command line.  Write a web application to perform image and container management.
</p>
Some things to consider:
<ul>
<li>What operations do you need to support?  </li>
<li>How do you want to limit access to the functionality (different levels of access: admin, operator)?  </li>
<li>What web development tools do you want to use?  </li>
</ul>
<strong>Likely Scope: 10 - 50 points</strong>

<hr>
<h2>Network Billing Tool</h2>
<p class="description">
You want to bill your customers, or roommates, based on the network traffic they generate.  Build a system to do so.
</p>
Some things to consider:
<ul>
<li>Is your tool slowing the network?  </li>
<li>How friendly are the reports generate?  </li>
</ul>
<strong>Likely Scope: 5-10 points</strong>

<hr>
<h2>Low Level Performance Test</h2>
<p class="description">
Bullwinkle and Rocky have on ongoing argument about how much of a performance penalty is involved with various virtualisation tools.  The best way to know is to test.  Devise and execute some tests to quantify the overhead for three main categories: CPU, Disk I/O, network I/O for one or more VM environments.  This a good one to do at home or in the class room with VirtualBox.
</p>
Some things to consider:
<ul>
<li>What tools will you use?  </li>
<li>How will you ensure that your results are repeatable?  </li>
<li>How will you present your results?  </li>
</ul>
<strong>Likely Scope: 5-10 points</strong>

<hr>
<h2> High Level Performance Test </h2>
<p class="description">
Once a system is build we need to conduct "end to end" performance tests.  For VDI projects this might be as 'simple' as organizing a group of your peers to use the application simultaneously.  Web applications can be tested with tools ranging from wget to commercial load generators.  This project is an opportunity to be a consultant to your peers.  If you develop a good testing methodology, you can help other teams test their projects and earn "Good Employee" points and get credit for your time spent.
</p>
